A Brief Introduction to GitHub for Social Scientists using Stata and Dropbox
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The purpose of this material is to serve just as an introduction to Github.
 I hope that this material can be useful for Social Scientists who are trying
 to integrate Github with Dropbox for the first time.
 This document should not be considered as representative of high standards
 of project management! For an advanced template of project management using
 GitHub, see the material that Pr.
 Jesse Shapiro shared in his Github (

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GitHub is a widely used online platform that computer scientists use to
 keep track of their codes and to collaborate in their projects.
 The word GitHub is the combination of Git with Hub.
 Git is a version control system that stores all the history of a code.
 With Git, programmers can check what they changed their codes, when they
 changed their codes, and they can also restore previous versions of their
 projects.
 GitHub is a web-based repository that keeps all the history of a code on
 a cloud using the Git system.
 Since everything is in a cloud, it allows many researchers to colaborate
 in a project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why should I use GitHub+Dropbox instead of just using Dropbox?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Dropbox is a great resource for teamwork.
 It allows many people to work on the same project and everything is automatical
ly syncronized across computers.
 However, as projects multiply, become larger and gain many collaborators,
 one may run into problems.
 First, if you have used Dropbox to work with many collaborators you probably
 noticed the generation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conflict
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 copies.
 This happens when Dropbox is not sure which version it should use because
 there is more than one sincronization happening at the same time.
 As I explain below, GitHub tends to avoid this problem because files are
 not automatically sincronized.
 Second, Dropbox lacks a more sophisticated system to track what changes
 in each version of a code.
 If something changes, we do not know who changed a code and what exactly
 changed in it.
 GitHub has an interface that makes it easy to identify these changes.
 Third, if you want to bring back previous versions of a project, GitHub
 can do it quickly, but with Dropbox, we can only bring back specific files
 one at a time.
 While some of these problems may be more likely to appear in large projects
 (imagine writing the codes for facebook for example...), as big empirical
 projects become more frequent in Economics, I believe that the use of Github
 will inevitably become more frequent as well.
 The main cost of using GitHub is that you have to be much more systematic
 about the way how you work since you have to manually sincronize your changes
 with the cloud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the difference between Dropbox and GitHub?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For me, the main difference between Dropbox and GitHub is that now we have
 an intermediary step for the syncronization of files called
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

commit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 In Dropbox, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{Master Repo (on the web)} & \iff\text{Local Repo (in your computer)},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where Master Repository is the cloud where the codes are and local repository
 is a copy of the Master Repository that you keep in your computer.
 If someone changes something in their Local Repository, things are automaticall
y sincronized with the Master Repository and across all the Local Repositories
 of other researchers working on the project.
 Therefore, if someone makes a mistake, this mistake spreads across the
 project and there is no straighforward way of identifying this mistake
 and going back to previous versions of the project.
 Now, with Git, we have an intermediary step
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Master Repo (on the web)}\iff\text{Commit}\iff\text{Local Repo (in your computer)},
\]

\end_inset

The way how sincronization works with Github is as follows.
 You first download all the repository containing the codes for the project
 to your computer using a process called 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
 if it is the first time that you are downloading the project and a process
 called 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pull
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
 if you are just updating the project to your local repo.
 Both are essentially downloading the files from the cloud.
 After you make your changes to the files, you can upload them to this intermedi
ary step called commit using a process called
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

add
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 You can upload these changes to the cloud using a process called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Push
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 GitHub keeps track of all the versions of the project.
 If someone makes a mistake, we can easily go back to the version of the
 project that existed before the mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Can I use GitHub as a repository for my datasets?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GitHub is a tool for keeping track of codes, but it is not supposed to be
 a repository for datasets.
 This is where an integration of Dropbox with Github is useful.
 GitHub can keep track of all the codes that are written for a project,
 and we can leave the datasets and output of the project (figures, tables
 and pdfs) untracked.
 For example, a researcher can keep track of do-files that clean the data,
 but only keep the final version of the cleaned dataset.
 The idea is that, by keeping track of the code, we can always go back to
 previous versions of the project and re-obtain previous versions of the
 cleaned dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prerequisites for this manual
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you move forward, make sure that you do the following
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Go to Github and set up an account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Follow their introduction guide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Go to Git website and install git.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Sincronization using GitHub
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to sincronize your files with the master repository.
 First, you can use a software called GitHub Desktop.
 This is a software where you can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point-and-click
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 your way through sincronization.
 I found this software quite user friendly.
 Second, you can use the Terminal in Mac
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If you are using a Mac computer and do not know what Terminal is, read this
 website 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href

target "https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (or the command line in windows).
 They may seem scary at first, but, in practice, you do not have to be a
 sophisticated programmer to use it.
 There are just a few commands that you have to use for your daily work.
 I see two main benefits in learning how to actually type the commands in
 Terminal.
 First, whenever you want to do something specific and you google about
 it, the answers that you get are mostly based on command lines.
 Therefore, to understand the answers that are given by the online community,
 you need to have a basic understanding of the language that they use.
 Second, there are some functionalities that I was not able to obtain with
 the graphical interface.

Issues

 Any collaborator in a project can create a new issue on the website associated
 with a repository and link their commits with these issues.
 For example, one can go to a repository and create an issue such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Add clustered standard errors in table 1
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 When the issue is created it comes with a number.
 Let's say this number is 1.
 When someone in project commits something related to the issue, this person
 can directly link his commit with the issue by writing in the beginning
 of the message #1.
 When you do so, the website will display a small notification under the
 issue with the user who updated the issue and also what was added there.
 You can also assign issues to specific people in the project.

A Brief Introduction to GitHub for Social Scientists using Stata and Dropbox
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The purpose of this material is to serve just as an introduction to Github.
 I hope that this material can be useful for Social Scientists who are trying
 to integrate Github with Dropbox for the first time.
 This document should not be considered as representative of high standards
 of project management! For an advanced template of project management using
 GitHub, see the material here

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GitHub is a widely used online platform that computer scientists use to
 keep track of their codes and to collaborate on their projects.
 The word GitHub is the combination of Git with Hub.
 Git is a version control system that stores all the history of a code.
 With Git, programmers can check what they changed in their codes and when
 they changed their codes.
 They can also restore previous versions of their projects if they do not
 like their new versions.
 GitHub is a web-based repository that keeps all the history of a code on
 a cloud using the Git system.
 Since everything is in a cloud, it allows many researchers to colaborate
 on a specific project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why should I use GitHub+Dropbox instead of just using Dropbox?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Dropbox is a great resource for teamwork.
 It allows many people to work on the same project and everything is automatical
ly synchronized across computers.
 However, as projects expand in terms of size and collaborators, one may
 run into problems.
 First, if you have used Dropbox to work with many collaborators you probably
 noticed the generation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conflict
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 copies.
 This happens when Dropbox is not sure which version it should use because
 there is more than one synchronization happening at the same time.
 As I explain below, GitHub tends to avoid this problem because files are
 not automatically synchronized.
 Second, Dropbox lacks a more sophisticated system to track what changes
 in each version of a code.
 If something changes, we do not know who changed a code and what exactly
 they changed in it.
 GitHub has an interface that makes it easy to identify these changes.
 Third, if you want to bring back previous versions of a project, GitHub
 can do it quickly, but with Dropbox, we can only bring back specific files
 one at a time.
 While some of these problems may be more likely to appear in large projects
 (imagine writing the codes for facebook for example...), as big empirical
 projects become more frequent in Economics, I believe that the use of Github
 will inevitably become more frequent as well.
 The main cost of using GitHub is that you have to be much more systematic
 about the way how you work since you have to manually synchronize your
 changes with the cloud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the difference between Dropbox and GitHub?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For me, the main difference between Dropbox and GitHub is that now we have
 an intermediary step for the synchronization of files called
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

commit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 In Dropbox, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{Master Repo (on the web)} & \iff\text{Local Repo (in your computer)},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where Master Repository is the cloud where the codes are and local repository
 is a copy of the Master Repository that you keep in your computer.
 If someone changes something in their Local Repository, things are automaticall
y synchronized with the Master Repository and across all the Local Repositories
 of other researchers working on the project.
 Therefore, if someone makes a mistake, this mistake spreads across the
 project and there is no straighforward way of identifying this mistake
 and going back to previous versions of the project.
 Now, with Git, we have an intermediary step
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Master Repo (on the web)}\iff\text{Commit}\iff\text{Local Repo (in your computer)},
\]

\end_inset

The way how synchronization works with Github is as follows.
 You first download all the repository that cointains the codes for the
 project to your computer.
 If it is the first time that you are downloading a project, you use a process
 called 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.

\emph default
 If you are just updating the project to your local repo, you use a process
 called 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pull
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 Both are essentially downloading the files from the cloud.
 After you make your changes to the files, you can then upload them to this
 intermediary step called commit using a process called
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

add
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 Once you added everything that you want, you use a process called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

commit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which basically packages all the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
adds
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that you made.
 You can upload this commit to the cloud using a process called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Push
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 GitHub keeps track of all the versions of the project.
 If someone makes a mistake, we can easily go back to the version of the
 project that existed before the mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Can I use GitHub as a repository for my datasets?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GitHub is a tool for keeping track of codes, but it is not supposed to be
 a repository for datasets.
 This is where an integration of Dropbox with Github is useful.
 GitHub can keep track of the codes that are written for a project, and
 we can leave the datasets and output of the project (figures, tables and
 pdfs) untracked.
 For example, a researcher can keep track of do-files that clean the data,
 but only keep the final version of the cleaned dataset.
 The idea is that, by keeping track of the code, we can always go back to
 previous versions of the project and re-obtain previous versions of the
 cleaned dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prerequisites for this manual
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you move forward, make sure that you do the following
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Go to GitHub and set up an account (

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Synchronization using GitHub
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to synchronize your files with the master repository.
 First, you can use a software called GitHub Desktop.
 This is a software where you can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point-and-click
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 your way through synchronization.
 I found this software quite user friendly.
 Second, you can use the Terminal in Mac
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If you are using a Mac computer and do not know what Terminal is, read this
 website 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "here"
target "https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (or the command line in windows).
 They may seem scary at first, but, in practice, you do not have to be a
 sophisticated programmer to use it.
 There are just a few commands that you have to use for your daily work.
 I see two main benefits in learning how to actually type the commands in
 Terminal.
 First, whenever you want to do something specific and you google about
 it, the answers that you get are mostly based on command lines.
 Therefore, to understand the answers that are given by the online community,
 you need to have a basic understanding of the language that they use.
 Second, there are some functionalities that I was not able to obtain with
 the graphical interface.

\end_inset

A symbolic link, also termed a soft link, is a special kind of file that
 points to another file, much like a shortcut in Windows or a Macintosh
 alias.
 Unlike a hard link, a symbolic link does not contain the data in the target
 file.
 It simply points to another entry somewhere in the file system.

Additional Features for Teamwork
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adding collaborators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To add collaborators into your GitHub repository, you can just use the github.com
 website.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Click on the repository of the project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Click on the settings of the repository (one of the tabs on the top).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Click on collaborators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Type the email of you collaborator and add him/her there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A useful tool for the organization of tasks in GitHub is the use of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Issues
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Any collaborator in a project can create a new issue on the website associated
 with a repository and link their commits with these issues.
 For example, one can go to a repository and create an issue such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Add clustered standard errors in table 1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 When the issue is created it comes with a number.
 Let's say this number is 1.
 When someone in the project commits something related to the issue, this
 person can directly link his commit with the issue by writing in the beginning
 of the message #1.
 When you do so, the website will display a small notification under the
 issue with the user who updated the issue and also what was added there.
 You can also assign issues to specific people in the project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Branches
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another useful tool for teamwork is the creation of branches.
 Let's say that you want to test the results from your paper using a restricted
 sample, but you do not want to affect your current results because it is
 possible that the restricted sample contains problems that you may find
 while working on it.
 In this case, you can create a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
branch
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is a parallel repo on the cloud that your co-authors can use.
 In that case, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{Master Repo (on the web)} & \iff\text{Commit}\iff\text{Local Repo (in your computer)}\\
\uparrow\downarrow\\
\text{Branch Repo (on the web)} & \iff\text{Commit}\iff\text{Local Repo (in your computer)}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

If the new sample works well, you may merge the branch with the master repo.
 If not, you can just delete the branch and the master repo will still be
 intact.

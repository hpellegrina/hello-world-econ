\begin_layout Title
A Brief Introduction to GitHub for Social Scientists using Stata and Dropbox
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This document should not be considered as representative of high standards
 of project management! I hope that this material can be useful for Social
 Scientists like me who struggled with the material that is available for
 social scientists on the internet.
 In particular, I could not find a specific document that addressed the
 integration of Dropbox with GitHub when a project uses larger datasets.
 Comments are very welcome!

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Github is widely used online platform that computer scientists use to keep
 track of their codes and to collaborate in projects.
 It is useful to understand the difference between Git from GitHub.
 Git is a version control system that stores all the history of a code.
 With Git, programmers can check what they changed in a code, when, and
 they can go back to previous versions of their project if they do not like
 the results of some changes that they made.
 Github is a web-based repository that keeps all the history of a code on
 a cloud using the Git system.
 Since everything is in a cloud, it allows many people to colaborate in
 the formulation of a code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why Should I use GitHub+Dropbox instead of just using Dropbox?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Dropbox is a great resource for teamwork in smaller projects.
 Many people work on a project and everything is automatically syncronized
 across computers.
 However, as projects multiply, become larger and gain many collaborators,
 there are several problems.
 First, if you have worked with Dropbox with many collaborators you probably
 noticed the typical generation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conflict
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 copies.
 This happens when Dropbox is not sure which version to use because there
 was more than one sincronization at the same time.
 As I explain below, GitHub tends to avoid this problem because files are
 not automatically sincronized.
 Second, Dropbox does not have a good system to track codes.
 If something changes, we do not know who changed a code and what exactly
 changed.
 GitHub has an interface that makes it easy to identify where exactly codes
 changed.
 Third, if you want to bring back previous versions of the project, GitHub
 can do it quickly, but with Dropbox, we can only bring back specific files
 one at a time.
 While some of these problems may be more likely to appear in large projects
 (imagine writing the codes for facebook for example...), as big empirical
 projects become more frequent in Economics, I believe that the use of Github
 will inevitably become more frequent as well.
 The main cost of using GitHub is that you have to be much more systematic
 about the way how you work since you have to manually sincronize your changes
 with the cloud.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the Difference between Dropbox and GitHub?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, the main difference between Dropbox and GitHub is that now
 we have an intermediary step for the syncronization of files called
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

commit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 In Dropbox, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{Master Repo (on the web)} & \iff\text{Local Repo (in your computer)},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where Master Repository is the cloud where the codes and their history is
 maintained and local repository is a copy of the Master Repository that
 you keep in your computer.
 In Git, we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Master Repo (on the web)}\iff\text{Commit}\iff\text{Local Repo (in your computer)},
\]

\end_inset

The way how sincronization works with Github is as follows.
 You first download all the repository containing the codes for the project
 to your computer using a process called 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
 if it is the first time that you are downloading the project and a process
 called 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pull
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
 if you are just updating the project to your local repo.
 Both are essentially downloading the files from the internet.
 After you make your changes to the files, you can upload them to this intermedi
ary step called commit.
 You can upload these changes to the cloud using a process called

\begin_layout Subsection
Can I use GitHub as a Repository for my Datasets?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GitHub is a tool for keeping track of codes, but it is not supposed to be
 a repository for datasets.
 This is where an integration of Dropbox with Github is useful.
 GitHub can keep track of all the codes that is written in a project, but
 not the datasets and output of the project (figures, tables and pdfs).
 For example, a researcher can keep track of do-files that clean the data,
 keeping all the versions of the code, but only keep the final version of
 the cleaned dataset and not its history.
 The idea is that, by keeping track of the code, we can always go back to
 previous versions of the project and re-clean previous datasets if the
 project is well organized.

Before you move forward, make sure that you do the following

\begin_layout Itemize
Go to Github and set up an account.

\begin_layout Itemize

Commands for Terminal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to sincronize your files with the master repository.
 First, you can with the Master repository using a software called GitHub
 Desktop.
 This is a software where you can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point-and-click
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 your way through sincronization.
 I found this quite user friendly.
 However, there were a couple of functionalities that I was not able to
 obtain with it.
 Second, you can use the Terminal in Mac
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If you are using a Mac computer and do not know what Terminal is, read this
 website 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or the command line in windows.
 They may seem scary at first.
 But, in practice, you do not have to be anythin near a sophisticated programmer
 to use it.
 There are just a few commands that you have to memorize for your daily
 work (or just use the list below).

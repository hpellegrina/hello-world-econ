# hello-world-econ
This is a Hello World for social scientists using Stata and Dropbox! Here, we will walk through the basics of GitHub: how to download a repository from the internet, how to integrate your repository with Dropbox, and how to upload the changes that you made in your repository to the cloud of GitHub.

Importantly, the purpose of this material is to serve just as an introduction to Github for social scientists. I hope that this material can be useful for people who are not familiar with the language of computer scientists and who are trying to integrate Github with Dropbox for the first time. Importantly, this document should not be considered as representative of high standards of project management! For an advanced template of project management, see https://github.com/gslab-econ/template. 

Find the pdf manual with all the instructions included in the folder "Documentation".

This is very preliminary! Any comments would be highly appreciated!

## Prerequisites

You need to have Stata installed in your computer, a GitHub account as well as Git. While I tried to be as self-contained as possible with this simple manual, I strongly recommend that you read some introductory material about what GitHub is.

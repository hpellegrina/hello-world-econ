# projects-hello-world-econ
This is a Hello World for economists using Stata and Dropbox (or GoogleDrive)! This is just a simple exercise that I created to share with people the way how I organize my projects. You will learn the basics of GitHub: how to download a repository from the internet, how to integrate this repository with Dropbox, and how to upload this repository that you created to the "cloud" of github after creating a simple figure. 

Importantly, this document should not be considered as representative of high standards of project management! I hope that this material can be useful for Social Scientists like me who struggled with the material that I could find on the internet. In particular, I could not find a specific document that addressed the integration of Dropbox with GitHub when a project uses larger datasets.

The manual with all the instructions is included in the folder "Documentation".

Comments are very welcome!

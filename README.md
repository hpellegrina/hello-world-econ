# projects-hello-world-econ
This is a Hello World for economists using Stata and Dropbox (or GoogleDrive)! This is just a simple exercise that I created to share with people the way how I organize my projects. It is not an example of high standards of project management. 

You will learn the basics of GitHub: how to download a repository from the internet, how to integrate this repository with Dropbox, and how to upload this repository that you created to the "cloud" of github after creating a simple figure. 

The manual with all the instructions is included in the folder "Documentation"

Comments are very welcome!
